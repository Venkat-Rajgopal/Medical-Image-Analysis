# About this Repo.

In this series we look at some fundamentals of Medical Image analysis using Python libraries like Scipy-image and visualize using MatplotLib. 

We analyse Medical images which are in this case human CT Scans of hand, chest or feet. 

We look at chest and arriving at more contrast images.

I have made the whole repo reproducible along with the [data](/Data). The dataset is drawn from the [Sunnybrook Cardiac Atlas Project](http://www.cardiacatlas.org/studies/sunnybrook-cardiac-data/). It has been de-identified and used as training data in a number of different competitions.
